This is one of my earlier backend projects that I revisited while reviewing core concepts. I enhanced it by adding a storage feature that saves notes or data to a local file.

The project already included functionality to delete individual notes, as well as a page transition feature â€” clicking "Read More..." navigates to a separate page with a unique URL based on the note's ID, where the specific card is displayed.


Do help me improve this code if you are going through this :)
